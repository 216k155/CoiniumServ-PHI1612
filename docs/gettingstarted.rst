Getting Started

Requirements
============

CoiniumServ is an platform-agnostic software which can run on any platform that dotNet_ or mono_ framework is available including Windows, Linux and Mac/OS.

* Windows: dotNet_ v4.5+.
* Linux: mono_ v3.2+.
* MacOS over mono_ v3.2+.

Once you do have either .net / mono installed, you can then run CoiniumServ. You have basically two options; compiling from source or using a binary distribution.

Binary Distribution
===================

Our binary distributions can work on any platform including Windows, Linux and MacOS. You can purchase a binary distribution over `here <http://www.coiniumserv.com/shop/releases/coiniumserv/>`_ to support the project.

Once you download the package, extract the contents to a suitable folder. Then you can simply run the **CoiniumServ.exe**

Then you have to configure the server to get it working.

Compiling from source
=====================

If you like you can get the sources of the project and compile yourself.

  * Windows_
  * Linux_
  * MacOS_
  
Then you have to configure the server to get it working.
